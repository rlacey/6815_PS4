Q1:How long did the assignment take?:
{A1: 12 hours}

Q2:Potential issues with your solution and explanation of partial completion (for partial credit):
{A2: RorB calculation after removing green produced output similar to the edgeGreen function. Intent was to remove green to improve red/blue response.}

Q3:Any extra credit you may have implemented:
{A3: None}

Q4:Collaboration acknowledgement (but again, you must write your own code):
{A4: Charles Liu}

Q5:What was most unclear/difficult?:
{A5: LogSNR, difficult to verify}

Q6:What was most exciting?:
{A6: Viewing the difference that edge based interpolation made. }

Q7:What ISO has better SNR?:
{A7: 3200-ISO}

Q8:Which direction you decided to interpolate along for the edgeBasedGreenChannel?:
{A8: The interpolation could be horizontal or vertical depending on the neighboring pixels, so both ways.}
